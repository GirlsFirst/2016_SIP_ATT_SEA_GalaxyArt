	<h2> Rules </h2> <br>
- No art theft! We can never stress this enough. Art theft is rude and not fair to the person who created the artwork. If you or someone has a problem with art theft please contact one of the moderators. <br>
- Watch your language -- towards others. We understand that people will use "profanity", and we honestly dont mind. However, if someone asks you not to swear on their post, then please, respesct that. Otherwise we will have to change this rule. <br>
- Don't bully!! It really is not nice and hurts others a lot whether they show it. We take bullying very seriously. and will terminate(deactivate) your account if you get reported multiple times. <br>
- No screenshots! You can only post a screnshot if you have a drawing in the post.<br>
